		      Chebfun system, Version 2

Installation instructions:

1. Unzip the contents of the zip file to a directory. We suggest the 
   name "chebfun" for this directory. Make sure to maintain the existing
   subdirectory structure of the zip package. (Please note: If you
   install into the "toolbox" subdirectory of the MATLAB program
   hierarchy, you will need to click the button "Update toolbox path
   cache" from the File/Preferences... dialog in MATLAB.)

2. In MATLAB, add the chebfun directory to your path. This can be done
   by selecting "File/Set Path..." from the main or Command window
   menus. We recommend that you select the "Save" button on this
   dialog so that chebfuns are on the path automatically in future
   MATLAB sessions.  (Alternatively, you can put an "addpath" command
   in your startup.m file, as described in the MATLAB documentation.)

3. A restart of MATLAB may be needed, if you want to access the user
   guides via the Help browser.

4. To check whether the system appears to be working, type "chebtest" at 
   the command window prompt. If a problem is reported, please contact  
   chebfun@comlab.ox.ac.uk with the details (including output of the 
   "ver" command).

Point your web browser to the guide/html directory of the chebfun
installation in order to read the user guides.
